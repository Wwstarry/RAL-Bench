description: 'Requests is a simple, elegant HTTP client library for Python. This task
  evaluates the core public APIs on a local HTTP server to avoid external network
  flakiness. Core modules/interfaces covered: - requests.api: high-level request helpers
  (get/post/etc.) - requests.sessions: Session lifecycle, cookies, adapters - requests.models:
  Request/Response objects and preparation - requests.auth: Basic authentication helpers
  - requests.exceptions: request error taxonomy
