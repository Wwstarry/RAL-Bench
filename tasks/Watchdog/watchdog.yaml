description: "Implement a pure Python filesystem monitoring library that is API-compatible\n\
  with the core parts of the reference watchdog project. The generated repository\
  \ must:\n\n- Provide the package structure required by the test suite, including:\n\
  \    * watchdog\n    * watchdog.observers\n    * watchdog.events\n\n- Implement\
  \ the Observer class with:\n    * schedule(handler, path, recursive)\n    * start(),\
  \ stop(), join()\n    * correct dispatching of filesystem events for created, modified\
  \ and deleted files.\n\n- Implement FileSystemEventHandler with overridable event\
  \ callbacks used by the tests,\n  including on_created, on_modified and on_deleted.\n\
  \n- Support non-recursive and recursive directory monitoring as exercised in the\
  \ test suite,\n  so that events from files created in subdirectories are observed\
  \ when recursive=True.\n\n- Behave in a way that allows all black-box tests under\
  \ ./tests/Watchdog/ to run\n  successfully on the generated implementation.\n"
