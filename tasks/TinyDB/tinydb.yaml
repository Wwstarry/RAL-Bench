description: Implement a lightweight local task manager backed by a JSON-based database.
  The tool should support creating tasks, organizing them into projects, updating
  fields such as status and estimates, and performing filtered queries. The API should
  expose basic CRUD operations and allow simple analytics-like queries (e.g., unfinished
  tasks per project). The system must remain file-based and require no external services.
