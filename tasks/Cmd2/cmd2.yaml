description: "Implement a pure Python interactive command-line application framework\
  \ that is\nAPI-compatible with the core parts of the reference Cmd2 project. The\
  \ generated\nrepository must:\n\n- Provide a top-level `cmd2` package containing\
  \ at least:\n    * cmd2\n    * cmd2.cmd2\n    * cmd2.parsing\n    * cmd2.utils\n\
  \n- Expose core public API used by the test suite, including:\n    * The Cmd2 class\
  \ (subclassing `cmd.Cmd`)\n    * Parsing utilities for arguments and options\n \
  \   * Output capture and transcript support\n\n- Support command registration via\
  \ `do_<name>` methods, help generation,\n  tab-completion hooks, and error reporting\
  \ consistent with the reference.\n\n- Implement transcript-based testing behavior\
  \ where scripted commands are run\n  and output is compared line-by-line.\n\n- Ensure\
  \ console output formatting, exception propagation, and command loop\n  behavior\
  \ align with what the black-box tests expect.\n\n- Provide enough compatibility\
  \ for test scripts to execute correctly on the\n  generated repository using the\
  \ same CLI interaction patterns.\n"
