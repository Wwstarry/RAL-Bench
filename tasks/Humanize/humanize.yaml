description: "Implement a pure Python humanization library that is API-compatible\
  \ with the\ncore parts of the reference humanize project. The generated repository\
  \ must:\n\n- Provide a top-level \"humanize\" package importable with `import humanize`.\n\
  \n- Match the package and module layout expected by the test suite, including at\n\
  \  least:\n    * humanize.__init__\n    * humanize.number\n    * humanize.time\n\
  \    * humanize.filesize\n    * humanize.lists\n    * humanize.i18n\n\n- Expose\
  \ number formatting helpers via the top-level package, including:\n    * humanize.intcomma\n\
  \    * humanize.ordinal\n\n- Expose size and time helpers via the top-level package,\
  \ including:\n    * humanize.naturalsize\n    * humanize.precisedelta\n    * humanize.naturaldelta\n\
  \    * humanize.naturaltime\n\n- Behave in a way that permits the same black-box\
  \ tests used for the reference\n  repository to run successfully on the generated\
  \ implementation, including\n  functional, performance, and integration-style tests\
  \ in this benchmark.\n"
