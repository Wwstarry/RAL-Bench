description: "Implement a pure Python command-line application framework that is API-compatible\n\
  with the core parts of the reference Typer project under ./repositories/typer.\n\
  The generated repository must:\n\n- Provide a top-level \"typer\" package importable\
  \ with `import typer`.\n\n- Expose the key public API used by the test suite, including\
  \ at least:\n    * typer.Typer for creating CLI applications.\n    * typer.Option\
  \ and typer.Argument for declaring options and arguments.\n    * typer.echo for\
  \ writing text to the console.\n    * typer.Exit for exiting with a specific status\
  \ code.\n    * typer.testing.CliRunner (or an equivalent testing helper) for invoking\n\
  \      Typer applications in tests.\n\n- Allow creating applications with multiple\
  \ commands via the Typer() object\n  and the @app.command() decorator, including\
  \ commands that accept positional\n  arguments and options with default values.\n\
  \n- Correctly propagate exit codes and error conditions when commands raise\n  typer.Exit\
  \ or return non-zero statuses, as exercised by the tests.\n\n- Generate help output\
  \ (--help) that includes a list of available commands\n  and basic usage information\
  \ for the application and its commands.\n\n- Behave in a way that allows the same\
  \ black-box tests used for the reference\n  repository to run successfully on the\
  \ generated repository, including the\n  exact public API names, module layout,\
  \ and the observable CLI behavior for\n  the usage patterns covered by the tests.\n"
