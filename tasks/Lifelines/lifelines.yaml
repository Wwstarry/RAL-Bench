description: "Implement a pure Python survival analysis library that is API-compatible\n\
  with the core parts of the reference lifelines project under ./repositories/lifelines.\n\
  The generated repository must:\n\n- Provide a top-level \"lifelines\" package importable\
  \ with `import lifelines`.\n\n- Expose the key public APIs used by the test suite,\
  \ including at least:\n    * lifelines.KaplanMeierFitter for univariate survival\
  \ estimation.\n    * lifelines.CoxPHFitter for Cox proportional hazards regression.\n\
  \    * lifelines.datasets.load_waltons to load the Waltons example dataset.\n\n\
  - For KaplanMeierFitter:\n    * Support .fit(durations, event_observed) to estimate\
  \ the survival function.\n    * Expose a .survival_function_ attribute as a pandas\
  \ DataFrame indexed by time.\n    * Provide a .predict(time) method that returns\
  \ the estimated survival probability\n      at the given time, with values in the\
  \ range [0, 1].\n\n- For CoxPHFitter:\n    * Support .fit(df, duration_col=...,\
  \ event_col=...) on a pandas DataFrame with\n      numeric covariates, fitting a\
  \ proportional hazards model.\n    * Expose a .summary attribute as a pandas DataFrame\
  \ containing at least the\n      coefficient (\"coef\") and standard error (\"se(coef)\"\
  ) columns.\n    * Provide a .predict_survival_function(row) method that accepts\
  \ a single-row\n      DataFrame and returns a survival curve with values in the\
  \ range [0, 1].\n\n- Provide a datasets submodule with a load_waltons() function\
  \ that returns a\n  pandas DataFrame containing at least the columns:\n    * \"\
  T\" (duration)\n    * \"E\" (event indicator)\n    * \"group\" (categorical group\
  \ label)\n\n- Behave in a way that allows the same black-box tests used for the\
  \ reference\n  repository to run successfully on the generated repository, including\
  \ the\n  exact public API names, module layout, and observable behavior for the\n\
  \  operations covered by the tests.\n"
