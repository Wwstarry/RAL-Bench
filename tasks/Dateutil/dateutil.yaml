description: "Implement a pure Python datetime utility library that is API-compatible\
  \ with\nthe core parts of the reference python-dateutil project under\n./repositories/dateutil.\
  \ The generated repository must:\n\n- Provide a top-level \"dateutil\" package importable\
  \ with `import dateutil`.\n\n- Match the key public API surface used by the test\
  \ suite, including at least:\n    * dateutil.parser.parse for parsing a wide range\
  \ of date and datetime\n      string formats into datetime objects, including ISO-8601\
  \ and\n      human-friendly formats.\n    * dateutil.relativedelta.relativedelta\
  \ for performing calendar-aware\n      arithmetic between date or datetime objects\
  \ (e.g., months, years, days).\n    * dateutil.rrule.rrule and related constants\
  \ (such as DAILY, WEEKLY and\n      weekday specifiers like MO, TU, WE, TH, FR)\
  \ for generating recurrence\n      sequences of datetimes.\n    * dateutil.tz (including\
  \ tz.UTC and tz.gettz) for working with time zone\n      aware datetime objects\
  \ and converting between time zones.\n\n- Correctly handle timezone-aware datetimes,\
  \ including conversions between\n  different time zones using tz.gettz and tz.UTC,\
  \ for the scenarios exercised\n  by the tests.\n\n- Produce stable and reasonable\
  \ recurrence schedules when using rrule with\n  weekly and daily rules and byweekday\
  \ filters, matching the reference\n  behaviour for the tested patterns.\n\n- Ensure\
  \ that parser.parse accepts the string formats used in the tests and\n  returns\
  \ datetime objects with appropriate tzinfo, with equivalent strings\n  parsing to\
  \ equal instants.\n\n- Behave in a way that allows the same black-box tests used\
  \ for the reference\n  repository to run successfully on the generated repository,\
  \ including the\n  exact public API names, module layout, and observable behaviour\
  \ for parser,\n  relativedelta, rrule and tz operations covered by the tests.\n"
