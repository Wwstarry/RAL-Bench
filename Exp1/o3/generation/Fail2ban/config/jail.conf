# Very small sample jail configuration for the stub Fail2Ban.
# Only the first section will be parsed by fail2ban.server.jail.Jail.from_config_file.
#
# Parameters understood by the stub:
#   failregex:  one (or multiple) regular-expression lines to be matched.
#   ignoreip:   space separated list of IPs never to ban.
#   maxretry:   number of failures within findtime that result in a ban.
#   findtime:   time window in seconds to look back for failures.
#   bantime:    duration in seconds for which an IP remains banned.
#
# All other settings are ignored.
